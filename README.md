# Crostini-CLM
Crostini (Linux) on chromebooks has always been confusing for some people, and borderline impossible for people like SHC students due to the enterpise policies. This repo will contain all of the information, files, and support that you will need to get started with Crostini.

**WARNING OF LIABILITY
READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING:**

Due to the nature of Linux/Crostini, we do not endorse any activity that you embark on while using Linux, this is merely a guide. **If you do decide to use Crostini, you are doing so at your own risk and we are not responsible for any repercussions you may face.**
Crostini also will require modification of your device's software, which can lead to issues such as crashes, hanging, and otherwise annoying bugs that will certainly annoy you.

Before you get too concerned and decide to quit: ChromeOS and Crostini all easily recoverable via standard means, and if it becomes too unstable you are able to use desperate measures like powerwashing or reinstalling the entire OS should it become required, of course always open a support request with us before you revert to those options if you are able.
