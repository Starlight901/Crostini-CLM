# Security Policy

Given the nature of SHC, we take Security extermely seriously due to Linux being heavily against the ICT Contract. 
Thanks to that strict contract, we have to implement a security policy.

As of right now, our main concern is the factor of IT discovering this repo. There for, as of right now you have to get manual authorisation to access this repo and it's documentation.
If you want to share access with someone, open an Issue report, give it an Access Request tag, and provide the Username or their perferred email so we can give them authorizaton.

We reserve the authority to remove anyone's access at any time should we believe they have become a security threat to this project.
